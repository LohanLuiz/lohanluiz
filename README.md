I'm studying the 7th period of Information Systems at Faculdade SAPIENS, but after all this time studying various things, I finally found something that I want to follow with everything, and it's, to become a web developer.

I am currently dedicating myself to learn the basic and advanced concepts about web development. 

Focusing on the ReactJS stack, which uses Node JS, React JS and React Native.

Also training my English to become as fluent as possible.


Gradually I get there! ðŸš€
